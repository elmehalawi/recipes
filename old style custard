6 eggs
4 cups milk
2/3 cup sugar
1-2 tsp vanilla
1/4 tsp salt
nutmeg 
cinnamon




Whisk eggs together in a large bowl. 
Add in salt, vanilla and sugar and mix together well. 
Heat milk and slowly pour into egg mixture while stirring. 
Pour into oven safe dish (I used two crocks). 
Sprinkle with nutmeg and cinnamon. 
Put about an inch of hot water in the bottom of another oven safe dish to create a water bath. 
Place dish with custard in the water bath and bake at 350 for 45-60 minutes or until toothpick inserted comes out clean.
