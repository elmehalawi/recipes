- Start boiling water in tea kettle or in a pot
- Wash rice in strainer and reserve
- In a pot, heat fat (oil, butter, or ghee) and add a handlful of egg noodles (the amount depends on your preference)
- Constantly stir the egg noodles. They burn very quickly so stir constantly
- When the noodles start to brown, add in all the rice and mix quickly so the noodles don't burn at the bottom of the pan
- Add salt, about 1/2 teaspoon per cup of rice, and mix
- The water in the kettle or other pot should have boiled by now, so add enough so that the surface of the water is about 1/2" above the rice
- Cover and simmer on low for 15 minutes. Do not uncover early
- Turn off the heat and leave it covered until it's ready to be eaten
